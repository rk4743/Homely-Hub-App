## Architecture and Design

HomelyHub uses Full Stack MERN development, which consists of four key technologies: MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. This unified JavaScript-based technology stack enables the creation of dynamic and scalable applications with a streamlined development workflow.

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing application data.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for building the backend server.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building the frontend user interface.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment for executing server-side code.
